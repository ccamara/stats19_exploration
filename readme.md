## STATS19  exploration

This repo contains a mock report exploring data from UK Department for Transport's [STATS19](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data) provided by [STATS19's R package](https://docs.ropensci.org/stats19/). This report serves several purposes:

1. to learn and understand what kind of data do the different datasets have,
2. to identify possible research questions,
3. to learn some new skills that I have never used before,
4. to showcase what I am capable of and increase my chances to get hired.

The report can be found here: https://ccamara.github.io/stats19_exploration/

**Disclaimer:** This report has been made in 12 hours by someone who had never worked with that kind of dataset before. As a result, it has to be considered as a draft and it might contain mistakes in writing and hasty conclusions.
