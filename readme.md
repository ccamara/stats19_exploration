## STATS19  exploration

This repo contains a mock report exploring data from UK Department for Transport's [STATS19](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data) provided by [STATS19's R package](https://docs.ropensci.org/stats19/). This report serves several purposes:

1. to learn and understand what kind of data do the different datasets[^datasets] have,
2. to identify possible research questions,
3. to learn some new skills that I have never used before[^new-things],
4. to showcase what I am capable of and increase my chances to get hired.
